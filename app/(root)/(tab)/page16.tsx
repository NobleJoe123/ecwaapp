          <Text style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>INTRODUCTION:</Text>The Bible has so many names and images for Jesus. One not in common use today is the name 'The Lamb of God'. This may not be unconnected with the fact that in the contemporary world, a lamb is seen as frail, helpless, warm and a woolly animal. Simply put, it does not represent that which holds much significance. Without the sacrifice of lambs in the temple and the offering of their blood, worship for the Jew was of no significance. It was the blood poured out on the altar that was offered as sacrifice to cover their sin. In the laying down of Jesus' life to die for us and the shedding of His blood for us at Calvary, God gave Jesus as a lamnb to be offered for our redemption and the forgiveness of our sins (Ephesians 1: 7).

          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.subtitle}>C. JESUS AS THE LAMB OF GOD</Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          1. <Text>Jesus was declared as the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world (John 1: 29).</Text>
        </Text>

        <Text style={styles.content}>
          2. <Text>Jesus willingly offered His body as a sacrifice for our sin (Hebrews 10:5-10).

        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          4. <Text>As the Lamb of God, Jesus was willing to be sacrificed. Never did a lamb go willingly to the 	sacrificial altar,  except the Lord Jesus Christ. He not only became our substitute, but He was a 	joyful and willing substitute! He did not protest in His suffering (John 10:11, 15, 17 â€“ 18).

        <Text style={styles.content}>
          7. <Text>By His sacrificial death on the cross as the Lamb of God, Jesus paid the price for sin so that all 	men who put their trust in Him will be saved (Romans 6: 23, 1 Peter 1: 18-21).


          </Text>
        </Text>

        <Text style={styles.subtitle}>CONCLUSION</Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          <Text>Without the shedding of blood, there will be no remission of sins (Hebrews 9: 24). This the blood of bulls and rams could not do as the sacrifices were repeated every year. But thanks be to Jesus, who gave Himself as the Lamb of God that was found worthy to be slain (Revelations 5: 12). Let us conclude by singing. "Worthy, worthy is the Lamb, that was slain".</Text>
